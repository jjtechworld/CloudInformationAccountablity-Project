          Cloud Information Accountablity Framework for Data Sharing                                                                     #Last Updated 2014-15

The main objective of the project is to provide accountability for data that is shared in the cloud among different cloud service providers. 
This is accomplished with the help of a Cloud Information Accountability Framework that keeps track of the actual usage of the data in the cloud and ensures 
that any access to user’s data will trigger authentication and automated logging. 
To strengthen user’s control we provide distributed auditing mechanisms where the data usage logs are sent to the owner at regular intervals.
